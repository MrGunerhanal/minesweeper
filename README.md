# Minesweeper

Please use the .exe file under either: Release > minesweeper.exe 
or in the solution: minesweeper > bin > Release > minesweeper.exe

Note the LOGIC of revealing empty tiles is correctly implemented. However, the UI code does respond to the logic and 
does not reveal the empty buttons around bombs or digits.
